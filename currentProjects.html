						<h3>Crasulla</h3>
						<p>
							This is my current project at the moment. It follows a personified succulent bowl as it traverses the land in order to cultivate as many plants as it can and destroy the evil viruses and bacteria. I'm almost done with the game but I had to prune many of the features that I wanted to add due to bad framework design. I'm looking forward to being able to make another game but this time with the help of a game engine.
						</p>
						<p>
							I am currently waiting for my amazing artist and friend 'manda to finish with the pixel art but it will soon be done.
						</p>
						<p>
							You can find the source code for this game at

						<h3>jlib</h3>
						<p>
							I am currently working on a library coded in C that will make some parts of C++ easier and provide functionality/classes that the c++ stl does not provide. I'm building it in C because I would like it to be something that I can use if I choose to use C for a project too and because it makes exporting it into a library easier.
						</p>
						<p>
							This was inspired by the lack of graphs and graph algorithms in the C++ stl and because I'm currently going through an algorithm text book and thought it would be good to implement some of them.
						</p>

						<h3>Music Producer</h3>
						<p>
							One of the things I find myself doing in my free time is making music. I started this is the December of 2018 and have made a couple of songs since. Even though it isn't a programming project, it is a big part of my life so I thought I would list it here.
