						<h3>Personal Web Server</h3>
						<p>
							I recently found a Raspberry Pi 2 sitting in my garage so I decided to set up my own web server instead of having to pay for one. To my surprise there were a lot of guides and the set up was reletively easy despite a lot of googling and a crash course in linux.
						</p>
						<p>
							It currently runs a LAMP web server and is configured to host multiple websites (though currently it is only hosting this website).

						<h3>Elimination</h3>
						<p>
							This was a website that I created to help Gunn High School play the game Elimination where you have to tag a person in real life, receive their target, and repeat until the game is over and hopefully you've eliminated the most number of people. In retrospect, it would have been better if I made the website look better rather than jush a bunch of input boxes. 
						</p>
						<p>
							Creating this website taught me more of the backend part of building websites, like the use of php and SQL.

						<h3>The Free-Form Scribe</h3>
						<p>
							I've released an alpha version of this app but there are still features and bugs that I wanted to add and fix. However, upon revisiting the code, I realized that what I have is beyond improving. The framework for the text documents allows for very little feature implementation (no way to implement bolding, italics, fonts, text color, and all other basic text features). To rework the framework would require a full rewrite so I think it is better to just scrap this version and recreate it from ground up if I still want to make a notebook like app.

						<h3>Tetris Remake</h3>
						<p>
							This is a tetris remake that I made as a challenge. I completed the remake within a 24 hours time constraint. There is still a bug where the piece disappears if you rotate it when it is diagonal to another piece but as it is past the 24 hour limit mark, I'm hesitant to go change it.
